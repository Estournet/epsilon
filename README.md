# Epsilon
School PHP project. It's a website that could be used to sell books.

# Installation
Use the file `epsilon.sql` to create the MySQL database. Parameters of the database can be set in the file `params_connexion.php`
Two accounts are already created : `admin:admin` and `user:user`. 


Enjoy !
